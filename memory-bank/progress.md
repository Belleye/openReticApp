# Project Progress

## What Works
- Repository initialized and project scaffold set up with Vite + React.
- Basic project structure implemented and memory bank established.
- Initial project documentation capturing requirements and design established.

## What's Left to Build
- Dashboard UI with reactive controls for irrigation zones.
- Integration with ESP32 for manual control, scheduling, and snooze functionality.
- Complete offline functionality testing and PWA service worker implementation.

## Current Status
- The codebase is currently in a UI demo/testing state, with no business logic, PWA service worker, or ESP32 integration yet implemented.
- The Demo component is a temporary test for Tailwind and shadcn/ui integration.
- In design and planning phase for core functionalities.

## Known Issues
- Detailed integration requirements with ESP32 yet to be finalized.
- Offline behavior and performance tuning pending further testing.

## Evolution of Decisions
- Iterative development with continuous integration of frontend and hardware communication.
- Early prioritization of offline-first capabilities and responsive design.
