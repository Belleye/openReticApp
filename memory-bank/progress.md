# Progress Update (2025-06-03)

## What Works
- **Settings Page Implemented**:
  - Users can customize zone names and colors, with changes saved to the ESP32.
  - Users can configure the ESP32 IP address/hostname, stored in `localStorage`.
  - `apiService` dynamically uses the configured endpoint.
  - Includes a "Test Connection" feature for the ESP32 endpoint.
- Zone cards display correctly with real-time manual run status and controls.
- Manual start/stop is now consistent: blue Start button, blue countdown/cancel button when running.
- Each zone's manual run timer auto-resets and updates the UI when elapsed.
- Snooze control is implemented with a modal, live countdown, and cancel functionality. Snooze resets automatically when time elapses.
- NavBar is now fully responsive: stacks vertically on mobile, horizontal on desktop.
- UI is clean and focused: removed unnecessary debug, titles, and descriptions per user feedback.
- Refresh button implemented: fetches `/getSchedule`, handles success/failure with messages (blue/red), updates state.
- Connection status reflected in UI: NavBar title shows "(Disconnected - Demo Mode)" when disconnected.
- Schedule Viewer page implemented using FullCalendar.
- Calendar displays events generated based on schedule entries.
- Add Schedule modal allows creation of new schedule entries.
- Edit Schedule modal allows modification/deletion of existing entries via calendar event click.
- Full UI CRUD operations for schedule management are complete and integrated with the API.
- Full schedule API integration complete:
  - `fetchSchedule` correctly reads from `/getSchedule`, converting UTC times to local and durations from seconds to minutes.
  - `saveFullSchedule` correctly writes the entire `{ schedule, system }` object to `/postSchedule`, converting local times to UTC and durations from minutes to seconds.
  - Add, Modify, and Delete actions in `ScheduleViewer` persist changes via the API using optimistic updates with rollback.
  - Manual zone start/stop controls in `Dashboard.tsx` now fully integrated with the ESP32 API (`saveFullSchedule`), sending the complete system state.
  - System snooze set/cancel controls in `Dashboard.tsx` now fully integrated with the ESP32 API (`saveFullSchedule`), sending the complete system state.
  - Fixed duration display in calendar events to consistently show minutes throughout the UI while maintaining seconds in the API.

## What's Left / Next Steps
- **UI Updates & Integration (Post-Settings Implementation)**:
    *   Ensure `ScheduleViewer` uses updated zone colors for events.
    *   Verify consistent color and name usage across all components.
- **Add tests for state logic and UI** (especially for Settings page, zone config, endpoint config).
- ~~Integrate with backend/ESP32 API for real device control (currently demo mode only)~~ (Largely addressed: Dashboard controls, snooze, schedule, and settings are integrated. Schedule execution by ESP32 still pending full validation).
- *Consider replacing inline refresh messages with a toast/notification system.*

## Learnings
- Settings Page implementation enhances user control and system adaptability.
- `localStorage` provides a good client-side solution for persisting ESP32 endpoint configuration.
- API integration for zone name/color customization ensures data consistency with the ESP32.
- Timer-based state management (for snooze and manual runs) is robust and keeps UI in sync.
- Consistent button design and embedded timers improve clarity and usability.
- Responsive design is critical for mobile usability; Tailwind's responsive utilities are effective for rapid fixes.
- Removing extra UI elements helps users focus on core controls.
- FullCalendar integration provides good schedule visualization.
- Correct time/duration conversions (`apiService`) are essential for API communication. The API expects durations in seconds while the UI displays them in minutes.
- API endpoint `/postSchedule` requires the full `{ schedule, system }` payload for all state changes (schedule, manual zone control, system snooze, zone settings).
- Zone color support has been added to the API and can be stored/retrieved successfully.

## Issues
- No major blockers. All implemented features are working as intended.

## Decisions
- Use context-based state for rapid prototyping and UI feedback.
- Favor simplicity and clarity in UI and controls.
- Use optimistic UI updates for schedule modifications and settings changes.
- Persist ESP32 endpoint in `localStorage`.

---
## New Requirements
- Zone colors are now supported in the API and should be displayed in the Schedule Viewer
  - Each zone has a `color` field (hex code) in the `system.zones` array
  - Default colors have been assigned but are user-configurable via Settings page
  - Colors should be used consistently across the UI to identify zones

This update reflects the current state of the openRetic PWA as of June 3, 2025.
