# Progress Update (2025-04-29)

## What Works
- Zone cards display correctly with real-time manual run status and controls.
- Manual start/stop is now consistent: blue Start button, blue countdown/cancel button when running.
- Each zone's manual run timer auto-resets and updates the UI when elapsed.
- Snooze control is implemented with a modal, live countdown, and cancel functionality. Snooze resets automatically when time elapses.
- NavBar is now fully responsive: stacks vertically on mobile, horizontal on desktop.
- UI is clean and focused: removed unnecessary debug, titles, and descriptions per user feedback.

## What's Left / Next Steps
- Add refresh button for schedule/zone state.
- Implement schedule viewer and editor per PRD.
- Integrate with backend/ESP32 API for real device control (currently demo mode only).
- Add tests for state logic and UI.

## Learnings
- Timer-based state management (for snooze and manual runs) is robust and keeps UI in sync.
- Consistent button design and embedded timers improve clarity and usability.
- Responsive design is critical for mobile usability; Tailwind's responsive utilities are effective for rapid fixes.
- Removing extra UI elements helps users focus on core controls.

## Issues
- No major blockers. All implemented features are working as intended in demo mode.

## Decisions
- Use context-based state for rapid prototyping and UI feedback.
- Favor simplicity and clarity in UI and controls.
