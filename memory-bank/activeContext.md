# Active Context (2025-04-29)

## Current Focus
- Robust, timer-driven controls for manual zone activation and snooze, with live countdowns and auto-reset.
- Clean, distraction-free UI: only essential controls and feedback are visible.
- Responsive design for all navigation and controls, ensuring mobile usability.

## Recent Changes
- Refactored Dashboard UI: removed debug/readout, titles, and descriptions for clarity.
- Manual zone control: blue Start button, blue countdown/cancel button when active.
- Per-zone timer logic for auto-reset of manual runs.
- Snooze control: modal for duration, live countdown/cancel button.
- NavBar: fully responsive for mobile and desktop.

## Next Steps
- Add refresh button for zone/schedule state.
- Build out schedule viewer/editor per PRD.
- Prepare for backend/ESP32 integration.
- Add tests for UI and timer logic.

## Active Decisions
- Use timer-driven state updates for all time-based controls.
- UI surfaces only essential controls and feedback for clarity.
- Responsive design is mandatory for all navigation and control elements.

## Learnings
- Timer-based state management (for snooze and manual runs) keeps UI and state in sync.
- Consistent button design and embedded timers improve clarity and usability.
- Responsive design is critical for mobile usability; Tailwind's responsive utilities are effective for rapid fixes.
- Removing extra UI elements helps users focus on core controls.
