# Active Context

## Current Focus
- The codebase is currently in a UI demo/testing state. Only Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui integration have been verified via a Demo component.
- No business logic, PWA service worker, or ESP32 integration is present yet.
- Planned: Setting up and integrating the Vite + React scaffold, PWA configuration including manifest and service worker, and initial UI components with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui.
- Planned: Implementing reactive binding for the scheduleData object and integrating manual and snooze functionalities.

## Recent Changes
- Repository initialization and project scaffolding completed using Vite + React.
- Basic UI and file structure established.
- Initial planning for integration with ESP32 HTTP endpoints accomplished.

## Next Steps
- Develop the Zone Dashboard with real-time status and controls.
- Integrate calendar/scheduler functionality.
- Test offline capabilities and PWA behavior.

## Active Decisions
- Use Vite + React as the primary development stack.
- Implement reactive state management using React hooks and Context API.
- Employ Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui for UI development.

## Learnings
- Reactive state management is critical for real-time updates.
- Offline-first PWA design requires thorough testing.
